#### Use these VScode launch.json and tasks.json to build and run the C++ project using the g++ compiler on Windows.

`tasks.json` scans all files (optimized for use on Windows) with the .cpp extension in all folders and subfolders, and compiles main.exe via g++ compiler

`launch.json` launches the built main.exe

yeah.. If you really need it...
